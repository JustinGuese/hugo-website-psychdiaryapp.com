      - question : "How do I get started with PsychDiary?"
        answer : "Getting started is simple! Just create an account (you only need an email address), and start writing your first diary entry. Write naturally about your day—there's no specific format required. The AI will automatically analyze your entry, detect your mood, and identify what made you happy or what challenges you faced. You can then explore your insights, chat with your AI companion, or view your mood analytics to see patterns over time."

      - question : "What should I write about in my diary entries?"
        answer : "Write about anything that's on your mind! You can reflect on your day, express gratitude, process difficult emotions, celebrate achievements, or simply capture your thoughts and feelings. There's no right or wrong way to journal—just write naturally. The AI will automatically understand your mood and extract meaningful insights from whatever you write, whether it's a few sentences or several paragraphs."

      - question : "How does the AI analysis work?"
        answer : "When you write an entry, our AI automatically analyzes it in real-time. It detects your mood (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative), identifies positive keywords and themes that made you happy, highlights challenges or stressors, and generates summaries of key moments. You don't need to manually tag anything or select from predefined categories—just write naturally, and the AI does the analysis for you."

      - question : "Do I need to format my entries in a specific way?"
        answer : "No! PsychDiary is designed to work with natural, free-form writing. You can write however feels most comfortable to you—whether that's structured paragraphs, bullet points, stream-of-consciousness, or anything in between. The AI understands natural language and will analyze your entries regardless of format. Just write from the heart, and let the AI handle the rest."

      - question : "How often should I write in my diary?"
        answer : "There's no requirement for how often you should write, but research shows that regular journaling provides the most benefits. Many users find daily reflection helpful, while others prefer a few times per week. PsychDiary includes an achievement system that rewards consistency—like daily reflection, weekly routines, and streak badges—to help you build a sustainable journaling habit. Write as often as feels right for you!"

      - question : "How does the AI psychologist companion work?"
        answer : "Your AI companion is a 24/7 mental health support system that learns from your diary entries. It remembers your entire journey, can reference specific moments from your past, and stores permanent facts about you (like names, preferences, and important details) so it always knows your context. When you say 'hello,' it proactively suggests topics from your recent entries to help you reflect. You can ask questions, process emotions, or have real-time conversations. The AI uses a sophisticated memory system with short-term memory for recent chats, long-term memory with automatic summarization, and permanent fact memory that never forgets important details about you."

      - question : "What is semantic search and how does it work?"
        answer : "Semantic search allows you to find diary entries by meaning, not just keywords. Instead of searching for exact words, you can ask natural questions like 'What did I write about feeling stressed?' or 'Show me entries about my vacation.' The AI understands the meaning behind your words using advanced vector embeddings, so it can find entries that are semantically similar to your query, even if you don't remember the exact words you used."

      - question : "How accurate is the mood detection?"
        answer : "Our AI uses advanced natural language processing to analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of your entries. While it's highly accurate at detecting overall mood patterns, it's important to remember that it's analyzing text, not reading your mind. The mood detection is designed to help you understand patterns over time rather than provide clinical diagnoses. If you notice any inaccuracies, you can always edit entries or provide feedback to help improve the system."

      - question : "What is the 'On This Day' feature?"
        answer : "The 'On This Day' feature lets you reflect on your journey across time by showing you what you wrote on the same date in previous years. This helps you notice how your thoughts and feelings have evolved, revisit important memories, and see how far you've come in your mental health journey. It's a powerful tool for recognizing growth and patterns in your emotional well-being."

      - question : "Can the AI replace therapy or professional mental health care?"
        answer : "No. PsychDiary is designed as a supportive tool for mental health, not a replacement for professional therapy or clinical interventions. While gratitude journaling and diary-keeping have been scientifically proven to improve mental health, they work best as part of a comprehensive mental health strategy. If you're experiencing severe mental health issues, please seek professional help. PsychDiary complements professional care and can be a valuable addition to your mental health routine."
